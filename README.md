Rail-to-Rail Comparator Design

Welcome to the Rail-to-Rail Comparator Design repository on GitHub! This repository contains the design files for a comparator circuit that operates with a rail-to-rail input common mode level.

About the Design

This design utilizes a low-power dynamic comparator and its complementary to form a rail-to-rail comparator. This structure keeps the latency low for the common mode variation from 0 to VDD.
The repository includes test benches for comparing the noise, offset, and latency of this rail-to-rail comparator with its conventional non-rail-to-rail counterparts.
